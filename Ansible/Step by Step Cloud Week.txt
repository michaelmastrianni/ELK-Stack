6- Start the ansible docker container with bash prompt
*	sudo docker run -ti cyberxsecurity/ansible bash
7- Run "ansible" to verify ansible is installed
8- Type exit to jump out of the container
9- View a list of containers that have ran on the instance and find the container name
*	docker container list -a
10- Copy the key into the container
*	sudo docker cp Oregon_Key.pem <container name>:/etc/ansible
11- Start the container
*	sudo docker start <container name>
12- Connect the bash shell of the container
sudo docker attach <container name>
13- move to the ansible folder

remote_user = ec2-user
16- Ping the second instance using the command below
*	ansible -m ping all --key-file Oregon_Key.pem
17- Create a playbook file and call it apache-playbook.yaml
---
- name: Apache install & start services
